        For each short code you want to use, add a hashtable with the following keys:
            id = at least one "word character" without the "start" or "end" characters.
                 for example, if you use '[gl:]' for 'https://google.com/', then the id
                 would be 'gl'
            name = A single word name for the shortcode
            uri = The URI of the link such as 'https://google.com/'
            type = The classification of the link, such as 'web', file, or 'unc'.  You
                   can use this field to filter and sort searches such as the output
                   of `Get-LinkShortCode`
